# Elliptic Curve ElGamal Encryption and Decryption

## Introduction

This Python program demonstrates the implementation of the ElGamal encryption and decryption scheme using elliptic curves (EC). ElGamal encryption is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm that is based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. In this implementation, elliptic curves are utilized to enhance the security of the encryption process.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
